# Tic-tac-toe
a hilariously bad coding of tic-tac-toe

This is a deliberately bad coding of a tic-tac-toe game designed for showcasing a beginner coding program to middle school students (ages 11-14). 

It has specific problems both with play and with code structure to entice them into asking what doesn't work and how to fix it.
